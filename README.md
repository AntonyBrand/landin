Collaborative transcription and translations of a 2001 talk by Professor Peter J Landin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMxLRJv6rpc

I used https://speech-to-text-demo.ng.bluemix.net/ to transcribe the audio but clearly with limited success. It needs humans to transcribe.

I have been using the site http://otranscribe.com/ as it is a great site for transcribing video, inserting clickable timecodes.
