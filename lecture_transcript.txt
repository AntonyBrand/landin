I have no slides. 



I think some of you might not realize what's a fantastically privileged audience you are because I have learnt so much from three preceding things. 

00:16 I'm one of those people that has never ever really understood anything unless I think I invented it myself and it's an extremely limiting view to do science





00:25 but I think today I've actually understood a number of things that have gone on since nineteen seventy where more or less I ceased to be interested in the theory of computing and I've understood things I always assumed were going to be much too complicated for me to ever understand or begin to understand so I've been quite,, I'm now energised into trying to understand a few things 



00:51  When I was very kindly invited to come here and it was by a very old  colleague of mine so I thought I was getting here, so to speak, out of, what's it called, cronyism namely George Davis, whom I first met over some old computer which I think is downstairs now complete with its telephone dial, is that right?



01:23 As I was wondering what to say here I was realizing that people of mixed biography and technical history except that my technical history stops about nineteen seventy.



So back in 1954 or sometime or other, having been thoroughly disparaging concerning computers because I'd watched something called an EDSAC up stumbling through a Runge-Kutta and decided this was not for me, but then I myself stumbled into a job trying 

Hollerith accounting machines do computing and indeed I spent a very engaging three months making Hollerith computing machines do a statistical analysis of the thermal conductivity of North Sea herrings some government office.



02:21 

This made me decide that maybe computing might be interesting after all because of a fortunate link that led me to George David here. I ended up at the National Physical Laboratory where he was with this early machine that's downstairs in pieces apparently, sorry depleted, where because I have a friend who didn't believe in the laws of probability and believed that parapsychology was an ordinary thing rather than a pathological thing I immediately set about testing whether the XXXX had parapsychological powers and I didn't, it didn't.



 03:00 

<audience> So far as you know.



03:04 It does produce the XXX Binomial distributions on those cards with little corners cut off which made lovely wallpaper




03:13 

Anyway not very long after then, I came, although he really didn't realize it, under the influence of John McCarthy, and indeed, I think all that work that I was doing that time was so much merely, was me thinking what I was doing to tidy up a few loose ends of McCarthy and probably not even realizing the loose ends of his that I was tidying up, what he considered to be the less important part of his contribution to the subject. I'm not sure about that but of course this lead to… 



 03:47 

I think LISP was around in 1958, at a NPL conference, and I was extremely excited to learn about garbage collection because I've been trying to think at the time how to do… 



03:59 

I knew about lambda calculus because when I was an undergraduate there was this… I was rather foolishly put into a fast lane of acquiring a degree in two years rather than three and consequently my first year was being taught analysis, this was in a mathematics degree, by an enthusiast for, and I think he'd been a pupil of Alonzo Church a very formidable man called Norman Steen who taught me analysis and during the time that this was going on the parallel stream got bigger and bigger and Lambda Calculus version of it got smaller in terms of audiences and at some point or other I and a friend of mine, we were room-mating together, realised that we were the only two people who were going to follow this particular stream and we better make sure that at least one of us was present at each lecture.



04:54 I know that there was one occasion that both of us had missed them and we thought, I think probably we were correct in supposing, because of the inflexible social manner of Norman Steen that he delivered his lecture anyway.



05:13 

and we didn't understand the notes to know whether there was a gap



05:23

So this connection with Lambda Calculus essentially came from there



05:27  

And I was determined to waste money to waste of the time of the English Electric Company by trying to make the XXXXX, it's immediate successor do beta-reduction. It was very very difficult with the delay lines that these drums and things



05:53 

so anyway… and then I encountered McCarthy and his beginnings of LISP, which were amazingly modest in their reliance… he had the word lambda but I don't think he knew what he was into at the time. It was a sort of FORTRAN-like language about lists, with the word lambda in it.



06:16 

anyway, what ensued, from that very rapidly became this language, which it was possible for somebody to design an abstract machine



06:27 

XXXX



Alan Gilmour's famous abstract LISP machine which was really an inspiration to me because that was exactly an extremely messy thing that I realised a way of tidying up, but at the time I was only tidying up. It was the SECD machine. I was tidying up this Gilmour machine and trying to put some kind of… crucially put some symmetry between treatments of functions and treatments of arguments, which were at the time, totally, I think, it was very ill-understood that a function could be a data item at the time



07:06 

So that's then how my lambda stuff arose, and by this time I had been assisting Christoper Strachey in debugging some of his programs, <laughs> by the famous method that <audience laughs> on our



XXXX- like machine



and thus, I joined him as his sole employee ever as a computer consultant and had a delightful four years working in a back studio somewhere off Kensington Church Street where there were three grand piano and two cats and during that time I was failing to produce a compiler for one of his industrial clients. I think I was supposed to be simulating, I was supposed to be equipping a new Ferranti computer with a Mercury Autocode- compatible compiler, that was it.



 08:17

so I decided that the only way to do it was with Lambda Calculus of course, because that was all I knew about and this then led to all that stuff that came out in the Vienna conference which Tony Moore mentioned. I don't know whether Tony Moore remembers but there were about 12 papers giving a variety



08:37 



XXXX

an account

sometimes silly

XXXX



08:43 

which is beautifully documented with, what do you call it, an account of the verbatim accounts of the discussions that went on after each talk, as I'm sure will be this thing.



08:58 

In one of the verbatim accounts, right at the end, yes, absurdly, whoever was organising it said "let's decide which is the best method of doing the semantics of programming languages, let's have a vote"



No I don't know which way Tony Hall voted but I won the vote. <laughs>



09:23 

by this time was on my way, indeed to MIT courtesy of that other great person that I was parasitical on apart from John McCarthy and that was Christopher Strachey, because he had spent a year there and, I'm getting confused by the time order, wait a minute now,  we've got as far as 1963–4 that's right.



09:49 

He spent a year at MIT under the patronage of a man who had a code, Robert Fano, had a code, Fano codes; information theorist, and they were trying to set up a teaching department in computing, it was, at the time there was something called "Project MAC" and Fano, who was an extremely energetic man who talked explosively and rapidly about everything with a strong Italian accent was absolutely indignant that he'd been required to teach a course in FORTRAN, 



10:29

Well he said "I've got to teach this course if I know what it's about and then he started telling me what the stuff was, It was gobble-de-gook, it was nonsense!" And I was by that time producing stuff about some kind of logical notion, really applying Tarski-type semantics stuff about the relationship between names and meanings to programming languages…



 10:54 

and this then led to me spending a year there out of which came this PAL thing that has been mentioned and during that time I can remember MIT, the department of Electrical Engineering as it essentially was, was in great turmoil of conflicting views about how to introduce computing into a graduate and then an undergraduate course. 



11:24 

  

Various people had become very heated about it, (Marvin) Minsky, that man who, I can't remember, forgotten the names now, senior moment



 11:47 

And Minsky was extremely hostile to this Lambda Calculus stuff, I think on the very reasonable grounds that he'd seen all these people getting grants for doing research in what were called Algol-like languages when they were actually studying language theory in a mathematical and automata related sense and he knew there was a big con going on about money being gained by sticking the word computer on to something.



 12:15 

I think he assumed that those of us who were talking about Lambda Calculus were similarly suspect, so he imported an old mucker of his called Dana Scott to come along and defeat me. This would have been about '66 I suppose, because meanwhile I'd moved from an industrial job, ah right, that's the chronological gap that I'd lost, I moved from an industrial job in America to a university job in America during that 3 years in the middle of the 60s. 





12:46 

So Scott came along and I won the argument, crucially on confluence, because I said, look, you've got to be able to have, to state the equivalence between an interior chunk of a program and another chunk that would do as well in that context. There's a word for that these days and I can't remember what it is.



 13:07 

He said you don't need to do that, because after all programs are just things you run, and so we had this heated argument about programming. He was one of the staggering examples of a person who, following up what Robert Milner was saying, was able, very very rapidly to get a practical grasp of programming alongside his already, and developing his great theoretical energy on the subject. I think that's very impressive, 



13:31 



and that's what was going on during that time leading to these famous lectures at Oxford that have been mentioned already. Subsequently though I can remember that I went to, I was in New York at this famous talk by, who's the man who did the "insertions" at the beginning? 

13:47 

audience

(Robert W.) Floyd



13:49 

I went along to a talk Floyd was giving in New York and indeed Scott was there. I realised at the time that I don't think I understood Floyd's assertions because I think I kept on oscillating between, are these things that are a proof aid or are they things that are implemented you run the program. I take it that they were the former and not the latter but I might be wrong.



14:14 

Scott was there, and that was a year after the famous Oxford Lectures which hinged on the question of typed structures versus non-typed structures and I can remember going off to Princeton for a few days with Scott then and being in this rather daunting situation of being the audience of one of him teaching me his latest system about neighbourhoods.



14:45 14:46 14:46 



So during all that time



Oh and of course this, amongst other things was followed by Scott going to, it must have been another meeting with Strachey, because by that time I think I'd lost contact with Strachey. 



15:03 I'm not talking about six…



15:04 

ah no I hadn't, anyway



I'm not going to talk technical because I feel, I think that you've had loads of technical stuff and it's hot and it's coming on to tea and I'm going to stop sooner than my advertised time



15:21 

It's funny actually, the other day, I was thinking about program verification, to which I did contribute a paper actually. That was one of the last papers I actually published. It was in 1967 or 8 or something or other and a colleague of mine who, I think it's a tragedy he's not here, namely Rod Burstall but he's got much more interesting things to do these days





15:44 

<audience>

Buddhism in France

15:46 

that's right 



 15:48 

we were very attracted by this McCarthy stuff about recursion/induction on proving a rather simple compiler correct but then we thought commutative diagrams and we did a commutative diagram thing about it, I was looking at it today, I looked up a copy of it, It's pages and pages. It depends on having a whole series of machines simulating one another and proving that they do.



16:17 

I'm sure it could all be done with categories these days in half a page but I don't know



 16:25 

What I was thinking of the other day was that until a couple of years ago, people who used the ATMs of the bank that I used to find that there was a tremendous uniformity about them and it was all very straightforward and then, there started to be filtered in, site by site, some revision of the machinery that among other things allowed for lots of pretty pictures and I take it, advertisements. 



16:53 

Unfortunately, it lacked two valuable features. 1: that when you put in your login 4 digit thing, it lacked the fact that it made a noise, which was very confusing and number 2: it lacked the fourth asterix that it displayed on the screen, so at the ATM near to where I live, queues built up because people tried five or six times assuming they'd made a mistake. By now everyone was used to this particular feature of this particular bank's ATMs I think.



 17:27 

over the last several years I've had some correspondence with them about it and it's very clear of course, that it's a very simple programming error, namely coming out of the loop at the wrong time and the fourth asterix does appear but disappears just before it appears or something like that.



17:44 

I eventually got them to concede that, yes, this is the case and they say that they will correct this in their 2002 update. 



17:56 

I think there's something interesting here apropos of what the stuff that this seminar is about, namely that what we are talking about is the stuff that will become the material of those people who, I've forgotten the word, the regulators of software will be depending heavily on the concepts that you have heard described and will continue to be described

 

18:29 

and because of course we now realise, if we consider the way that regulation has had its effect in numerous industries, most recently agriculture, we realise that there are many other contributing factors, to the work of regulation than the technical things that are provided for them by the scientists



18:49 

on the other hand, of course, it is essential to their work that these scientists are providing some legitimacy for this. I think that we have to be aware, that maybe already, there are little bits of regulators doing this, and some of my colleagues here already work on these government committees that do it, but I don't. 



  19:09  

the stuff that we are now… that is being talked about today; the topics are going to be certainly the topics that will be, as the scientific journalists in these controversial issues say, of course, were too difficult to actually present to the politicians, let alone the public but nevertheless played an essential part.



19:32 and of course the dialectic that then goes on is that, there's always room to renew the debate by saying, we didn't bother mentioning vaccines to you because we didn't think you wouldn't understand them. 



19:44 

Now you mentioned it, yes it is true that we could have done so-and-so with vaccines. I predicted in three weeks time we will learn that Britain, although it persuaded Western Europe to abandon vaccination, I'm talking about these cow things, in 1991, it will turn out totally consistently with all these other assertions that Britain has been vaccinating for the last ten years.



20:10 

I'm going to stop



20:21 

<compere>

Questions for Peter?

 



 20:24 

audience: I have one



Peter:go on



20:27 

very much with Rob who would have loved to have been here but he's away on meditation practice. He's out in France.

20:37 

And I remember this algebra paper you wrote, two planes of algebra…



Peter: that was quite a different thing, it was another topic entirely



that was a later one was it?



Yeah,  this one was called "Progams and their proofs; an algebraic approach"



Oh I remember that one as well



20:54 

The real question was, what led you to the algebraic work?



21:00 

Oh because, as well as being taught Lambda Calculus as an undergraduate, I was taught universal algebra, and I was probably just in an incredibly lucky situation at that time in round about 1960 or something or other, to be one of the few people who were engaged in computing who knew about Lambda Calculus and Universal Algebra.





21:28 

and going back to Robin Bloomfield's question about communities, can you add any details to this bookshop story?



21:45 

When I ceased to be an undergraduate, and because of having been fast-laned through all these things and leaving with a rather ambiguously low grade degree, I was very uncertain what to do with my life and spent the next six months in Sheffield reference library trying to avoid making a decision about my life



22:06 

I used to go out to a café; a housewife's café just around the corner from the Sheffield Reference Library in the centre of this town Sheffield where I was born and grew up and one day I was having my coffee in Field's Café and a voice came booming across the housewifes' tables, I say this because that's exactly what it was in those days



22:27 And this voice said: "I say! Didn't I see you reading Principia Mathematica in the reference library this morning?"



22:37 And thus I got to know the legendary Mervyn Pragnell, who immediately tried to recruit me to his reading group, which at that time was halfway through the twelve volumes of Gibbon's Decline and Fall (of the Roman Empire)





22:53 

Then I left town and got to avoid him, and ran into him in a London street shortly after I'd come to live in London and he said "I've got a reading group now and we are reading…" and it turned out to be Markov's vast book on algorithms.



 23:15 

The texture; the structure of these meetings of Bernards were very, sort of, theological in style, you would read in clockwise order, aloud, pages, mining the formulas to the best of your ability, thus many such books were read.



23:42 

Who was in the group at the point you joined and who else joined?

23:45 

During that time I suppose that quite a number of the people… I don't know, I can't remember whether Robin Milner…



23:51 

<Robin Milner?>

I came once or twice



23:53 

I don't blame you!

23:58 

Certainly, that's how Rod and I met each other, the method of recruiting was actually at Dillons (bookshop), not XXXX.  



 24:12 

And I know that at one time, Mervyn had encountered a person there, an elderly and rather apoplectic gentleman who said, "are you looking for the books on logic?" and this man said yes, and he said "oh, would you like to join my study group? 





24:29 

And I have a friend called Peter Landin who's joining" and then this bloke turned out to be Lord Halsbury who was doing the kind of joint venture schemes on the financing of British computing at the time. And he declined the invitation.



24:51 

The other people involved, there was a man who very much a machine architecture person, John Ive/Ireland (?) 



25:01  

and of course there was George Coulouris who took up the..  it was actually the CPL, somebody should have said that it actually stood for "Christopher's Programming Language", … as well as all the other things it stood for



25:15



<audience>

I wrote an article about Christopher last year in which I said some people thought of it as "Christopher's Programming Language"  and I was allowed to get away with that but one of the editors was very insistent that no one should say that it actually was called "Christopher's Programming Language". 





25:31  

I think it was both the name as much a moving target as the language



25:38

 John Reynolds

25:39

<audience>

Could you say a bit about Penrose's involvement



25:44 

Well, yes, it's ___ at odds with something I read afterwards in a long-ish biographical essay concerning Christopher Strachey that appeared in, ___



25:56 

my memory is that, it might be my personal hubris, that rather similarly to Dana Scott being called in to kill me by Minski, that Roger Penrose had been called in to kill me by Strachey. And again one survives these terrible ordeals____





26:21 

If it was true that Penrose, because they were "muckers" from years back, that Penrose had told Strachey about Lambda Calculus, I think he'd forgotten by the time he'd left me





26:35 



<audience >

Richard Bornat, Queen Mary College

You said that we'll be tools of regulators in the future and I fear you're going to be right. But is the science that we do, or that we do science? Should we be doing something else

26:47 

I don't think so no!

I think the question is who,



26:59 

See, at the moment, everything that counts as science is something that has a job number, or a proposal number, a grant number 



27:06  

and more or less, I think what you might be doing or innovating wouldn't count as science if it was not done like that. It's staggering that this paper of mine that very kindly allowed me to sort of live off a state pension for 15 years or something "Mechanical Evaluation of Expressions" because I was in a rather similar situation somebody someone mentioned earlier today that I benefited amazingly from noone seeming to value what I was doing for about 15 years and go on living on it.



27:46 

when accreditation indices were being invented and I started to live in this new managerialised university life that hit us some time in the 80s and I was very distressed because I didn't have any numbers and grant numbers and proposal numbers and things and also I didn't think my citation index would stand up to much, so I invented a few names for the things I was studying and one was the "lagged citation index"



28:16 

<giggles from audience>



28:22 



I scored really highly



28:28 

So, what I mean is if there were, 

I do know a few of my colleagues who have since dropped out of both industrial and/or academic computing and believe that they have lent their services to what you might call intermediate technology and  stuff like that but should imagine that it's a pretty low level from our point of view, although I know people who similarly, not in computing,  but in engineering got an immense satisfaction by successfully launching five kinds of lavatory for the third world and things like that.

okay thank you very much Peter
